# Pokecord Cheater
This project was created to help me cheat at the discord bot Pokecord game.
My bot uses google to reverse image search the picture of the pokemon and find out its name.
The name can then be broadcast to the channel or via dm.
log is kept in a txt file.
Settings for the mode, the API token, and the dm list are stored in a JSON File
